# üçÉ windy
An SDL3 widget that attempts to looks like the good ol' Windows Vista/7 weather
widget

## Introduction
Even though I'm a Linux user 99% of the time, one of the few things I miss is
the weather widget from Windows Vista/7: it's simple, but I genuinely find it
attractive and useful.

While there are various weather widgets for Linux using Conky, I've never come
across one that resembled the Windows 7 version. So, I decided to create my own
in C+SDL3. It's open source and works on Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS, and Windows.
