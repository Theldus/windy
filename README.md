An SDL3 widget that attempts to looks like the good ol' Windows Vista/7 weather
widget

## Introduction
Even though I'm a Linux user 99% of the time, one of the few things I miss is
the weather widget from Windows Vista/7: it's simple, but I genuinely find it
attractive and useful.

While there are various weather widgets for Linux using Conky, I've never come
across one that resembled the Windows 7 version. So, I decided to create my own
with C and SDL3. Windy is open source and works on Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS, and
Windows.

## How to use
### Quick Explanation:

Change the following lines of `request.py` file with the lat/long of your city
(exact location not needed!):
```python
#
# Example:
# LATITUDE="35.69"
# LONGITUDE="139.69"
# LOCATION="Tokyo, Japan"
#
LATITUDE="<change to your location>"
LONGITUDE="<change to your location>"
LOCATION="<City, State>"
```

and then run:
```c
$ ./windy -c "python request.py"
```

### Detailed Explanation:

Unlike most weather programs/widgets, Windy doesn't attempt to embed one or more
forecast APIs within itself. Instead, it delegates this responsibility to an
external program/script.

Windy accomplishes this by invoking an external script provided as a parameter by
the user. This script returns JSON output through stdout, which Windy reads and
displays on the screen. Essentially, Windy serves as a GUI for an external
program.

By default, Windy provides the `request.py` script, which uses the
[OpenMeteo's API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) to fetch weather information.
However, users can supply any script, program, etc., in their preferred language,
as long as it follows the JSON format below:
```json
{
    "temperature": 22,
    "condition": "clear",
    "max_temp": 20,
    "min_temp": 15,
    "location": "Tokyo, Japan",
    "provider": "OpenMeteo",
    "forecast": [
        {
            "max_temp": 34,
            "min_temp": 27,
            "condition": "rainfall"
        },
        {
            "max_temp": 34,
            "min_temp": 27,
            "condition": "clouds"
        },
        {
            "max_temp": 34,
            "min_temp": 27,
            "condition": "clouds"
        }
    ]
}

```
acceptable values for `condition` are: `clear`, `fog`, `clouds`, `showers`, 
`rainfall`, `thunder`, and `snow`.

### Command-line arguments:

Windy also supports changing the weather update interval (`-t`) and the screen
coordinates (`-x` and `-y`) where it should appear. Below are all the available
options:
```text
$ ./windy -h
Usage: ./windy [options] -c <command-to-run>
Options:
  -t           Interval time (in seconds) to check for weather
               updates (default = 10 minutes)
  -c <command> Command to execute when the update time reaches
  -x <pos>     Set the window X coordinate
  -y <pos>     Set the window Y coordinate
  -h           This help

Example:
 Update the weather info each 30 minutes, by running the command
 'python request.py'
    $ ./windy -t 1800 -c "python request.py"

Obs: Options -t,-x and -y are not required, -c is required!
```

## Building
Windy requires `SDL3`[^sdl3_note] and `SDL3_ttf` to build, if you don't have
them installed and your distro/OS doesn't have packages for them (highly likely,
as they're still under development) build with CMake:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Theldus/windy.git
$ cd windy
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j4
```
CMake will check if the libs can be found on the system, and if not, it will
download and build them.

Optionally, if you are running Linux and already have the libraries installed on
your system, just a 'make' is enough:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Theldus/windy.git
$ cd windy
$ make -j4
```

[^sdl3_note]: SDL3 is the first version of SDL to support transparent framebuffer, 
which is why version 3 is required.
